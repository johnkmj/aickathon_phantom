Smart Clothing Recycling/Sharing service.

We start off with a stash of clothing, like a library.

User comes in, we take a photo of the user with his/her clothing, as well as get size.
  Api identifies his/her age, sex and current clothing.
  App to do the best match (simple recursive searching, tbd implementation) based on his/her photo

A quick result is given back directly.
